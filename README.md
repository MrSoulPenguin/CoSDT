# Hardercore
A mod that implements my stupid ideas to make Minecraft "harder".

As I am self taught and this isn't an important project, things might not be done 
in the correct/most optimal way. So things will be implemented in either the way 
I know, or could be fucked to do.

Example:
  I know using a block mixin and listening for block breaking isn't the proper
  way to modify loot tables. But as it's the only loot table I wanted to change,
  I don't care. If I add more modifications to other loot tables, I'll do it
  properly.
