# CoSDT (Compilation of Stupid Difficulty Tweaks)
A mod that I work on when bored, that implements my stupid ideas
to make Minecraft "harder". Basically an outlet for dumb ideas 
that I can't put into my other projects.

As I am self taught and this isn't an important project, things might not be done 
in the correct/most optimal way. So things will be implemented in either the way 
I know, or could be fucked to do, unless it actually causes issues.

Example:
  I know using a mixin to inject into one of the Block#dropStacks() methods isn't 
  the proper way to modify loot tables. But as I only wanted to change on loot table, 
  I don't care. If I add more modifications to other loot tables, I'll do it properly.
